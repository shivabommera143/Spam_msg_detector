ðŸ“© SMS Spam Detector

This is a machine learning web app that detects whether an SMS message is Spam or Ham (not spam). Built using FastAPI, it leverages Naive Bayes and TF-IDF vectorization to classify messages with high accuracy. The app includes a simple, clean web interface where users can type or paste a message and get an instant prediction.

The model was trained on the spam.csv dataset from Kaggle. This project is fast, lightweight, and interactive. It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world text classification problems, like spam detection, and can be easily extended to emails, chat messages, or deployed online.
